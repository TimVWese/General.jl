# General.jl

This badly named package adds some functions to ease my research.
They are mainly extensions to [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) (more network models, IO) and [NetworkDynamics.jl](https://github.com/PIK-ICoNe/NetworkDynamics.jl) (some simple vertex and edge dynamics, multiplex supporty).

See the docs for full functionality.
